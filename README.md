# Contact-Manager-Using-Trie
A CLI-based Contact Manager built in C++ using Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure. This project demonstrates efficient contact storage, prefix-based search (like auto-complete), editing, and deletion operations using fundamental DSA concepts. It is ideal for showcasing real-world use of tries and hash maps in a fast, searchable contact system.
